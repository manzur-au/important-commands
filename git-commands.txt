Initializing a Repository in an Existing Directory. If you have a project directory that is currently not under version control 
and you want to start controlling it with Git, you first need to go to that project’s directory. If you’ve never done this, 
it looks a little different depending on which system you’re running:

for Linux:
$ cd /home/user/my_project

for macOS:
$ cd /Users/user/my_project

for Windows:
$ cd C:/Users/user/my_project

and type:
$ git init

You shour change the defauls 'master' branch to 'main' as github now uses 'main' as default:
git config --global init.defaultBranch main

to rename a brunch:
git branch -m <name>

To add existing file in version control:
$ git add *.*
$ git add LICENSE
$ git commit -m 'Initial project version'

Clone this Repo:
$ git clone https://github.com/manzur-au/important-commands.git
